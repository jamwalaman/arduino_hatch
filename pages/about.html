			<h1>About Us</h1>

			<p>SeeHow is a new small group of collaborative artists with diverse backgrounds formed together to enter the developing realm of the ICT industry of Dunedin. The team is built with 5 local members of Ōtepoti, Alister Butterfield, Aman Jamwal, Isaac Burwell, Julie Lawerence and Jono Manning. We are an online learning resource for kids to spark their interests in electronics and computing so they can learn and seeHOW they work. We provide step by step tutorials for our seeHOWers, catering for each type of learner in the classroom, through visual, reading & writing and kinesthetic learning.</p>

			<p>Our vision is to transform minds through digital play, to promote fast-forward learning environment and acknowledging the role of risk taking in learning. The key aspect for us is to feed kids curiosity, kids are naturally extremely inquisitive, but as they get older, society tends to wear that aspect down in so many people, so we want to feed that curiosity so we can break that cycle.</p>

			<h1>About this project</h1>

			<p>The goal of our project is to expose kids to a basic level of computing and electronics. We want to excite them and demystify it for these young users by making it accessible and showing them how on a basic level, how simple it can be, yet also rewarding. As a result we hope that we can further ignite their creativity and imagination when it comes to problem solving. A key aspect of our learning goal is to work to minimum viable systems, troubleshoot, then move on. This concept runs deep in digital tech and enables feedback. All we want to do is show kids how these feedback loops work, and see how they put them to use.</p>

			<p>Using Arduino technology we provide kids with easy to follow guides to build their own arduino bots. Educating them to understand the process of creating an input, resulting in an output - set something, do something, show something. Enabling them to grasp the basic concepts into electronics, physics and coding.</p>

			<p>As a result we believe we can <b>Ignite the power of play</b> to create a pathway into the future for young creative minds to blossom and shape the world of tomorrow. </p>
